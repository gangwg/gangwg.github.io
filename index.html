I'm a currently postdoctoral associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

at the University of Minnesota

where I am a member of the <a href="http://spincom.umn.edu">SPiNCOM</a> 
I am a member of the SPiNCOM group directed by Prof. <a href="http://spincom.umn.edu/georgios/">Georgios B. Giannakis</a>. I earned my Bachelor degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology,

Beijing, China in 2011, and Ph.D. degree from the University of Minnesota in 2018, both in Electrical Engineering.</p>
