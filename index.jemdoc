# Building on truncated amplitude flow, we propose stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithms to solve for the orthogonality-promoting initialization instead of the gradient-type power method, and stochastic gradient descent- or Kaczmarz-based iterations to refine the initialization. #Our algorithm termed Stochastic Truncated Amplitude Flow
. 12/2017: Paper “Solving Random Systems of Quadratic Equations via Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow” was presented at the *NIPS’2016*
#The proposed algorithm benchmarks the performance of solving generalized phase retrieval under Gaussian random measurements or coded diffraction patterns.
